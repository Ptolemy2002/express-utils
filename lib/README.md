# React Library CRA Project
## Meta
This is a Library Created by Ptolemy2002's [cra-template-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ptolemy2002/cra-template-react-library) template in combination with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). However, it does not actually depend on React - it has been modified to work with Express. It contains methods of building and publishing your library to npm.

## Peer Dependencies
These should be installed in order to use the library, as npm does not automatically add peer dependencies to your project.

## Commands
The following commands exist in the project:

- `npm run uninstall` - Uninstalls all dependencies for the library
- `npm run reinstall` - Uninstalls and then Reinstalls all dependencies for the library
- `npm run example-uninstall` - Uninstalls all dependencies for the example app
- `npm run example-install` - Installs all dependencies for the example app
- `npm run example-reinstall` - Uninstalls and then Reinstalls all dependencies for the example app
- `npm run example-start` - Starts the example app after building the library
- `npm run build` - Builds the library
- `npm run release` - Publishes the library to npm without changing the version
- `npm run release-patch` - Publishes the library to npm with a patch version bump
- `npm run release-minor` - Publishes the library to npm with a minor version bump
- `npm run release-major` - Publishes the library to npm with a major version bump
